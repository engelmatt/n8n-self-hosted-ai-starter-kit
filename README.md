# Self-hosted AI starter kit

**Self-hosted AI Starter Kit** is an open, docker compose template that
quickly bootstraps a fully featured Local AI and Low Code development
environment.

Curated by <https://github.com/n8n-io>, it combines the self-hosted n8n
platform with a curated list of compatible AI products and components that
lets you build production-level AI workflows in minutes.

store with an comprehensive API

✅ [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) -  Workhorse of the Data
Engineering world, handles large amounts of data safely.

### What you can build

⭐️ AI Agents which can schedule appointments

⭐️ Summarise company PDFs without leaking data

⭐️ Smarter slack bots for company comms and IT-ops

## Installation

### For Nvidia GPU users

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-demo.git
cd self-hosted-ai-demo
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

### For everyone else

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-demo.git
cd self-hosted-ai-demo
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

> [!TIP]
> If you’re using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can run Ollama on
> your host machine for faster GPU inference. Unfortunately, you can’t expose
> the GPU to Docker instances. Check the
> [Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/) for installation instructions, and
> use `http://host.docker.internal:11434/` as the Ollama host in your
> credentials.

## ⚡️ Quick start and usage

The Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a docker compose file pre-configured with
network and disk so there isn’t much else you need to install.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You’ll only
   have to do this once.
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb>
3. Select **Test workflow** to start running the workflow.
4. If this is the first time you’re running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.1. You can inspect the docker
   console logs.

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.

With your n8n instance, you’ll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
> workflows. While it’s not fully optimized for production environments, it
> combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
> projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs

## Upgrading

### For Nvidia GPU users

```
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia pull
docker compose create && docker compose up
```

### For everyone else

```
docker compose --profile cpu pull
docker compose create && docker compose up
```

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The Self-hosted AI Starter Kit will create a shared folder (by default, located in
the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and allows n8n to
access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is located at
`/data/shared` - this is the path you’ll need to use in nodes that interact
with the local filesystem.
